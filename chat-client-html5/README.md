# chatroom client for html5

This is a simple chatroom client built with [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) + [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org).

And here you could find some sample code about how to use Aurelia in TypeScript, too.

# how to build the code

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) have been installed.

2. From the project folder, execute the following commands one by one:

```shell
npm install
jspm install
typings install

npm run build-only
npm run start
```

And finally just open the following URL in your browser to run the client: &nbsp; http://localhost:9090/dist
